## Skeyword

Unify keyword search among your web browsers with this Python script.

When you often switch between web browsers and can't due without those time-saving keyword shortcuts to search your favorite sites, it's a hassle to keep them manually synced. Run this script in the background and you'll be able to access the same keyword searches from every browser.


### Setup

1. Add your favorite search engines to the keywords.json file
2. Launch a Terminal and run the Skeyword script:

        python skeyword.py --port 8001

3. Open your web browser and browse to http://localhost:8001/
