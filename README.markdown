When you often switch between web browsers and can't due without those time-saving keyword shortcuts to search your favorite sites, it's a hassle to keep them manually synced. Run this script in the background and you'll be able to access the same keyword searches from every browser.

### Setup

2. Launch a Terminal and run the following command:

        python skeyword.py
